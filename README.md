### My Thoughts
all in all it wasnt very fun and i dont understand a majoirty of it
in the guide there was a source code file (raycaster_flat.cpp) that you were basiclly meant to copy while reading the notes
and since i wrote it in rust i had to transfer it over and it really sucked
i spent a lot of time transfering the original c++ file into rust and it barely works
im going to try code something like this in c by follow some guides i found
